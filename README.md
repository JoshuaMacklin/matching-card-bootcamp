# Matching Card Game

### Goal: Make a 10 card memory game - users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I made it as interactive as possible using CSS to rotate the cards 180 degreees in a 3d style. Compared to the card instantly changing, this makes it feel as if you're truely flipping a card!
